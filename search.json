    "text": "Adapting to Rapid Skill Acquisition\nIn this course, students are expected to rapidly acquire new skills, a critical aspect of data science. To emphasize this, consider this insightful quote from VanderPlas (2016):\n\nWhen a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member, or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it’s less a matter of knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown answer. In data science it’s the same: searchable web resources such as online documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you’ve found yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you don’t know, whether through a web search engine or another means.\n\nThis quote captures the essence of what we aim to develop in our students: the ability to swiftly navigate and utilize the vast resources available to solve complex problems in data science. Examples tasks are: install needed software (or even hardware); search and find solutions to encountered problems.",

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nWhat is an Operating System?\nAn operating system (OS) manages your computer’s resources (CPU, memory, storage, files, and processes) and provides interfaces (GUI and terminal) for people and programs to interact with hardware.\n\n\n\n1.1.1 The big three\n\nWindows — Ubiquitous on personal laptops; historically less aligned with Unix tooling, but excellent with WSL.\nmacOS — Unix-based; ships with a terminal and many developer tools out of the box.\nLinux — Open-source family used on servers, clusters, and cloud VMs; many distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian) share common command-line tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhy this matters in data science\nReproducibility and collaboration require knowing your OS, versions, and paths. Most research servers and HPC clusters run Linux. Learning a command-line interface (CLI) gives you a common language across systems.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Quick checks: what am I running?\nOpen a terminal and run one of the following:\n# macOS / Linux / WSL\nuname -a\n# Windows (PowerShell)\nver\nIf you see Linux details on a Windows laptop, you are inside WSL.\n\n\n1.1.3 File systems and paths\n\nUnix-like path style: /home/alex/project/data.csv\nWindows path style: C:\\\\Users\\\\Alex\\\\project\\\\data.csv\n\nOn macOS/Linux, your home is typically /Users/&lt;name&gt; (macOS) or /home/&lt;name&gt; (Linux). On Windows, it is usually C:\\\\Users\\\\&lt;name&gt;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNaming habits that save you pain\nAvoid spaces in file and folder names. Prefer kebab-case or snake-case. Keep a project’s scripts, data, and reports together.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\nWSL lets you run a real Linux environment (e.g., Ubuntu) inside Windows, so your terminal commands match those of macOS/Linux users. This is the recommended setup for Windows in this course.\n\n1.1.4.1 Install WSL (Windows 11 or Windows 10 ≥ 2004)\n\nOpen PowerShell as Administrator.\n\nRun:\n\nwsl --install\n\nWhen prompted, choose Ubuntu and set a Linux username and password.\n\n(Optional) Ensure WSL2 is the default:\n\nwsl --set-default-version 2\n\nVerify:\n\nwsl --status\nwsl -l -v\nYou should see Ubuntu listed and version 2.\n\n\n1.1.4.2 Start using WSL\n\nLaunch the Ubuntu app (or run wsl in PowerShell).\n\nYou are now at a Linux shell (bash). Try:\n\npwd         # current directory in the Linux filesystem\nls          # list files\nwhoami      # your Linux username\n\n\n1.1.4.3 Sharing files between Windows and WSL\n\nWindows drives are mounted inside Linux at /mnt/c, /mnt/d, …\nExample: C:\\\\Users\\\\Alex\\\\project appears at /mnt/c/Users/Alex/project inside WSL.\n\nYour Linux home is separate (e.g., /home/alex).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBest practice\nKeep course projects inside your Linux home (e.g., /home/&lt;name&gt;/dsda1010) to avoid path and permissions surprises.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4.4 Line endings and Git on Windows/WSL\nConfigure Git once to avoid CRLF/LF confusion:\ngit config --global core.autocrlf input   # recommended in WSL/macOS/Linux\ngit config --global init.defaultBranch main\nAdd a .gitattributes to normalize endings:\n* text=auto\n*.qmd text eol=lf\n*.R   text eol=lf\n*.md  text eol=lf\n*.yml text eol=lf\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Terminal quickstart by OS\n\nmacOS: Open Terminal (or iTerm2). You are in a Unix shell. Commands from the book work as-is.\n\nLinux: Open your terminal (GNOME Terminal, Konsole, etc.). You are already in a Unix shell.\n\nWindows (WSL): Open the Ubuntu app (WSL). You are now in a Linux shell that matches macOS/Linux.\n\nTry these commands everywhere:\npwd           # show current path\nls -lah       # list with details and human-readable sizes\nmkdir lab     # make a folder\ncd lab        # enter it\ncurl --version\nR --version   # verify R once installed later\n\n\n1.1.6 Common pitfalls and fixes\n\n“Command not found” — The program is not installed, or your PATH does not include it.\nPermission denied — You may be in a protected folder; work in your home directory.\nStrange characters in filenames — Avoid spaces and punctuation; stick to letters, numbers, dashes.\nMixing Windows and WSL paths — Prefer working inside your WSL home. If you must access Windows files, use /mnt/c/....\n\n\n\n1.1.7 Hands-on check (to do now)\n\nOpen your terminal (macOS/Linux/WSL).\n\nConfirm your OS with uname -a (or ver in PowerShell).\n\nCreate a course folder and a notes file:\n\nmkdir -p ~/dsda1010/week1\ncd ~/dsda1010/week1\necho \"Week 1 notes\" &gt; notes.txt\nls -l",

Variable types determine how we visualize, summarize, and analyze data.\nVariables are broadly divided into numerical and categorical. Numerical variables can be continuous, such as income or life expectancy, or discrete, such as the number of siblings or a graduation year. Categorical variables can be nominal, with no inherent order (for example, country or gender), or ordinal, with an order that matters (such as education levels or rankings). R also provides support for logical variables, representing true/false values, and date variables, with built-in functions for handling time information.\n\n\n\nVariable types\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Example: variable types in gapminder\nglimpse(gapminder)\n\n\nRows: 1,704\nColumns: 6\n$ country   &lt;fct&gt; \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", \"Afghanistan\", …\n$ continent &lt;fct&gt; Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, Asia, …\n$ year      &lt;int&gt; 1952, 1957, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987, 1992, 1997, …\n$ lifeExp   &lt;dbl&gt; 28.801, 30.332, 31.997, 34.020, 36.088, 38.438, 39.854, 40.8…\n$ pop       &lt;int&gt; 8425333, 9240934, 10267083, 11537966, 13079460, 14880372, 12…\n$ gdpPercap &lt;dbl&gt; 779.4453, 820.8530, 853.1007, 836.1971, 739.9811, 786.1134, …\n\n\nUnderstanding variable types is not just theoretical.

    "text": "4.4 Messy Data\nReal-world datasets are rarely clean. Messiness can arise from missing values, inconsistent formats, poorly named variables, or categories coded in multiple ways. Dates might appear in different styles, proper nouns might be inconsistently capitalized, and numeric values might be stored as text.\nCleaning data involves identifying and fixing these problems. R provides many tools for this work. Missing values can be detected with is.na() and handled using functions such as na.omit(). Variable names can be adjusted with rename(). The mutate() function can change types or create new variables, and joins such as left_join() allow information from multiple tables to be combined.\n\n\nCode\n# Example: identify missing values in gapminder\nsum(is.na(gapminder))\n\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nThe tidyverse philosophy emphasizes keeping data in a “tidy” format, where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observation forms its own table. Working toward tidy data makes later analysis and visualization much easier.",

(Based on Raghabendra Chattopadhyay and Esther Duflo. 2004. “Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India.” Econometrica, 72 (5): 1409–43.) We will analyze data from an experiment conducted in India, where villages were randomly assigned to have a female council head. The dataset is in the source of the class notes “data/india.csv”. As shown in Table 5.1, the dataset contains four variables.\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: Variables in india.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nvillage\nvillage identifier (“Gram Panchayat number _ village number”)\n\n\nfemale\nwhether village was assigned a female politician: 1 = yes, 0 = no\n\n\nwater\nnumber of new (or repaired) drinking water facilities in the village\n\n\n\nsince random assignment\n\n\nirrigation\nnumber of new (or repaired) irrigation facilities in the village\n\n\n\nsince random assignment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the correct R code, set your working directory.\nLoad the tidyverse package.\nLoad the data as a data.frame and assign the name india to it.\nUtilizing either head() or glimpse() view the first few rows of the dataset.

In other words, how many villages were part of this experiment? Additionally, provide a substantive answer.\n\nLand of Opportunity in the US Chetty et al. (2014) show that children’s chances of rising out of poverty in the U.S. vary sharply across commuting zones, with higher mobility in areas with less segregation, less inequality, stronger schools, more two-parent families, and greater social capital. The data and its variable dictionary are available as data/Chetty_2014.csv and data/Chetty_2014_dict.csv. Here we look into a subset of the data, exploring the relationship between economic mobility and CZ characteristics: household income per capita (hhi_percap). The mobility measure that you will use in this analysis captures the probability that a child born to a parent in quintile 1 moves to income quintile 5 as an adult (prob_q1q5).\n\nRead and filter data to get data only for the 100 largest commuting zones (CZ). You will work with filtered data, chetty_top100, throughout this lab.\nMake a scatterplot with household income per capita (hhi_percap) on the x-axis, and mobility (abs_mobility) on the y-axis. (A) Describe the graph: what is the approximate range of the x-axis? (B) What is the approximate range of the y-axis? (C) Do you think there is a relationship between these two variables?\nUse color to represent the geographic region (region) to your scatterplot. (A) What patterns does this reveal? (B) Describe the distribution of the data, by region.\nRepresent geographic region (region) on your scatterplot using shape instead of color. Compare the use of color vs shape to represent the region: what are the benefits and drawbacks of each?\nGoing back to the graph you just made, which uses color to represent the geographic region, add another aesthetic to represent the size of the population (pop_2000, population from the 2000 Census). Describe any relationships between size and region.\nSplit your plot into facets to display scatterplots of your data by region. (A) Compare this split plot to the combined plot earlier. Are there aspects of the relationship between hhi_percap and mobility that are easier to detect in the faceted plot than in the combined plot? (B) Which regions appear to have a relatively stronger relationship between hhi_percap and mobility?\nAdd information on the census division (division) to your graph using the color aesthetic. (A) What does this reveal about divisional differences in the West?\nCreate a plot of the relationship between hhi_percap and abs_mobility with two layers: (1) A scatterplot colored by region, and (2) a smooth fit chart with no standard error also colored by region. (A) What patterns does this illustrate in the data?\nCreate a bar graph that displays the count of CZs by region and fill each bar using information on census division. What do you learn from this graph? (A) Make new bar graphs with position dodge. (B) Make new bar graphs with position fill.\n\n\nWhat is the relative advantage of each of the three bar graphs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChetty, R., Hendren, N., Kline, P., & Saez, E. (2014).
