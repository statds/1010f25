## Sources at GitHub
These lecture notes for STAT/DSDA 1010 in Fall 2025 are developed 
by Professor Jun Yan, with help from generative AI and the students 
enrolled in the course. This cooperative approach to education was
facilitated through the use of GitHub, a platform that encourages
collaborative coding and content development. To view
these contributions and the lecture notes in their entirety, please
visit our GitHub repository at <https://github.com/statds/1010f25>.


Students are welcome to contribute to the lecture notes by submitting
pull requests
to our GitHub repository. This method not only enriched the
course material but also provided students with practical experience
in collaborative software development and version control. 

## Adapting to Rapid Skill Acquisition

In this course, students are expected to rapidly acquire new skills, a
critical aspect of data science. To emphasize this, consider this
insightful quote from @vanderplas2016python:

> When a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member,
> or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it's less a matter of
> knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown
> answer. In data science it's the same: searchable web resources such as online
> documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a
> wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you've found
> yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is
> less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible
> situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you
> don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.

This quote captures the essence of what we aim to develop in our
students: the ability to swiftly navigate and utilize the vast
resources available to solve complex problems in data science.
Examples tasks are: install needed software (or even hardware);
search and find solutions to encountered problems. 


## Course Tools

- **R & RStudio** for analysis
- **Quarto** for reproducible documents and dashboards
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and project management

## Homework Logistics

### Workflow of Submitting Homework Assignment

+ Click the GitHub classroom assignment link in HuskyCT announcement.
+ Accept the assignment and follow the instructions to an empty
  repository.
+ Make a clone of the repo at an appropriate folder on your own
  computer with `git clone`.
+ Go to this folder, add your qmd source, work on it, and group your
  changes to different, meaningful commits.
+ Push your work to your GitHub repo with `git push`.
+ Create a new release and put the generated pdf file in it for ease
  of grading.

### Homework Requirements

+ Use the repo from Git Classroom to submit your work. See Section @sec-git.
    - Keep the repo clean (no tracking generated files).
    - Never "Upload" your files; use the git command lines.
    - Make commit message informative (think about the readers).
    - Make at least 10 commits and form a style of frequent small commits.
+ Use `quarto` source only. See @sec-quarto.
+ For the convenience of grading, add your standalone pdf
  output to a release in your repo.

## Final Project Logistics

<!-- Many data science teams are composed of professionals from varied -->
<!-- backgrounds. These individuals work together to identify and answer -->
<!-- interesting business and research questions using data. Participating -->
<!-- in this group project will give you insight into working on a data -->
<!-- science team, and working through the Tidy Data Workflow to transform -->
<!-- a set of questions into a well-designed product that communicates -->
<!-- clear findings. -->


<!-- For your final project, you will be divided into groups of four. Your charge is to identify a data set and complete a data analysis that answers one or more questions. Your project should generally follow the process of the Tidy Data Workflow. As this charge can be interpreted broadly, more information is outlined below. -->

<!-- This project is designed as a capstone experience, bringing together most of what you have learned this semester. You will work as a team, as most data scientists do, to analyze a historical or contemporary case study. The goal is to illuminate the issue through visualization of data, and encourage exploration by providing a user interface in an R Shiny application. -->

## Final Project Logistics

Many data science professionals work independently while collaborating
across teams. This final project will give you experience completing a
full data analysis cycle on your own, following the **Tidy Data
Workflow** to transform questions into a well-designed product that
communicates clear findings.

For your final project, you will work **individually** to identify a
data set and complete a data analysis that answers one or more
questions. Your project should generally follow the process of the Tidy
Data Workflow. As this charge can be interpreted broadly, more
information is outlined below.

This project is designed as a capstone experience, bringing together
most of what you have learned this semester. You will complete all
aspects of the project yourself—planning, analysis, visualization, and
communication—to simulate the end-to-end workflow of a professional
data scientist. The goal is to illuminate the issue through
visualization of data and encourage exploration by providing a user
interface in an **R Shiny** application.

### Tip
Start identifying your data source early. A good data set is rich,
clean enough to work with, and aligned with your interests.
:::

### Goals

- Produce an end-to-end data science project  
- Take full ownership of your analysis and communication  
- Identify interesting data sets, develop questions that can be
answered with available data, use data science techniques to draw
insights, and present those insights clearly and convincingly  

### Deliverables

- Project Proposal
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Final Presentation
- Final Report

### Rationale for the Individual Project

- Simulates independent data science work from start to finish  
- Encourages personal accountability and self-management  
- Provides flexibility to pursue topics reflecting individual interests
and strengths  
- Gives practice communicating insights in multiple formats  
- Ensures that each student demonstrates mastery of all phases of the
data science workflow  

### Project Grading

- Total project grade out of 20 points  
  + Project Proposal = 5 points  
  + Exploratory Data Analysis / Proof of Concept = 5 points  
  + Final Presentation = 5 points  
  + Final User Report = 5 points  

To eliminate subjectivity from grading:  
- Follow instructions  
- Meet deadlines  
- Address all rubric items  
- Produce a cohesive, reproducible workflow  

Areas of subjectivity include verbal and written communication,
graphics grammar, product design, and text mechanics.

::: callout-tip
### Tip
Follow each rubric item carefully and proofread your materials before
submission.
:::

### Project Expectations

You are responsible for managing your own timeline, ensuring that each
deliverable is completed on time, and seeking feedback from the
instructor when necessary. You may informally discuss ideas with
peers, but all coding, analysis, and writing must be your own work.
