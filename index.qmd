## Adapting to Rapid Skill Acquisition

In this course, students are expected to rapidly acquire new skills, a
critical aspect of data science. To emphasize this, consider this
insightful quote from @vanderplas2016python:

> When a technologically-minded person is asked to help a friend, family member,
> or colleague with a computer problem, most of the time it's less a matter of
> knowing the answer as much as knowing how to quickly find an unknown
> answer. In data science it's the same: searchable web resources such as online
> documentation, mailing-list threads, and StackOverflow answers contain a
> wealth of information, even (especially?) if it is a topic you've found
> yourself searching before. Being an effective practitioner of data science is
> less about memorizing the tool or command you should use for every possible
> situation, and more about learning to effectively find the information you
> don't know, whether through a web search engine or another means.

This quote captures the essence of what we aim to develop in our
students: the ability to swiftly navigate and utilize the vast
resources available to solve complex problems in data science.
Examples tasks are: install needed software (or even hardware);
search and find solutions to encountered problems.
