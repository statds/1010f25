# Exercises {#sec-ex}


1. **Setting up the computing environment**
  Using the right computing tools and environment is a prerequisite
  of data science projects. Set up your computer for this course
  with the following steps. For each step, document what you did,
  the obstacles you encountered, and how you overcame them. If you
  used AI, document your prompts. Note that the steps you take may
  depend on your computer's operating system.Think of this as a user
  manual for students who are new to this. Use the command line
  interface.
    a.  Install R.
    a.  Install Positron or RStudio.
    a.  Install Quarto.
    a.  Set up SSH authentication between your computer and your
	  GitHub account.
    a.  Render your homework into an HTML file.
    a.  Print the HTML file into a pdf file and put it into the
      release of this homework assignment.

1. **Getting familiar with command line interface**
  The command line interface (CLI) is widely used among computing
  professionals, even though graphical user interfaces (GUI) are more
  common for everyday users. Be clear and concise in your
  explanations. Provide short examples if you think they will help
   illustrate your points.
    a.  Research and explain why many professionals prefer using the
   CLI over a GUI.  Consider aspects such as efficiency, automation,
   reproducibility, or remote access. 
    a.  Identify your top five favorite commands in the Unix/Linux
   shell. For each command, explain what it does. If there is an
   option/flag you found particularly useful, describe it.
    a. Identify your  top five favorite Git commands. For each
   command, explain what it does. If there is an option/flag you found
   particularly useful, describe it.

1. **Do women promote different policies than men?**
   @chattopadhyay2004women studied whether female policymakers make
   different choices than male policymakers by exploiting a unique
   natural experiment in India. India’s 1993 constitutional amendment
   required that one-third of village council head positions
   (pradhans) be randomly reserved for women, creating a setting where
   the assignment of female leaders was exogenous. In the data here,
   villages were randomly assigned to have a female council head. The
   dataset is in the source of the class notes  “data/india.csv”.  As
   shown in @tbl-india, the dataset contains four variables.
  
   | variable     | description                                                                 |
   |--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | *village*    | village identifier ("Gram Panchayat number _ village number")               |
   | *female*     | whether village was assigned a female politician: 1 = yes, 0 = no           |
   | *water*      | number of new (or repaired) drinking water facilities in the village        |
   |              | since random assignment                                                     |
   | *irrigation* | number of new (or repaired) irrigation facilities in the village            |
   |              | since random assignment                                                     |

    a.  How many observations are in the dataset? In other words, how
	many villages were part of this experiment? Additionally, provide
	a substantive answer.

1. **Land of Opportunity in the US**
  @chetty2014where show that children’s chances of rising out of
  poverty in the U.S. vary sharply across commuting zones, with
  higher mobility in areas with less segregation, less inequality,
  stronger schools, more two-parent families, and greater social
  capital. The data and its variable dictionary are available as
  `data/Chetty_2014.csv` and `data/Chetty_2014_dict.csv`.
  Here we look into a subset of the data, exploring the
  relationship between economic mobility and CZ characteristics:
  household income per capita (`hhi_percap`). The mobility measure
  that you will use in this analysis captures the probability that a child
  born to a parent in quintile 1 moves to income quintile 5 as an
  adult (`prob_q1q5`).
    a.  Read and filter data to get data only for the 100 largest
    commuting zones (CZ). You will work with filtered data,
  `chetty_top100`, throughout this lab.
    a.   Make a scatterplot with household income per capita
    (`hhi_percap`) on the x-axis, and mobility (`abs_mobility)` on the
    y-axis. (A) Describe the graph: what is the approximate range of
    the  x-axis? (B) What is the approximate range of the y-axis? (C)
    Do you think there is a relationship between these two variables? 
	  a.   Use color to represent the geographic region (region) to your
    scatterplot. (A) What patterns does this reveal? (B) Describe the
    distribution of the data, by region.
    a.  Represent geographic region (region) on your scatterplot using
    shape instead of color. Compare the use of color vs shape to
    represent the region: what are the benefits and drawbacks of each?
    a.  Going back to the graph you just made, which uses
    color to represent the geographic region, add another aesthetic to
    represent the size of the population (`pop_2000`, population from the
    2000 Census). Describe any relationships between size and region.
    a.  Split your plot into facets to display scatterplots of your
    data by region. (A) Compare this split plot to the combined plot 
    earlier. Are there aspects of the relationship between 
    `hhi_percap` and mobility that are easier to detect in the faceted
    plot than in the combined plot? (B) Which regions appear to have
    a relatively stronger relationship between `hhi_percap` and mobility?
    a.  Add information on the census division (`division`) to your
    graph using the color aesthetic. (A) What does this reveal about
    divisional differences in the West?
    a.  Create a plot of the relationship between `hhi_percap` and
    `abs_mobility` with two layers: (1) A scatterplot colored by
    region, and (2) a smooth fit chart with no standard error also
    colored by region. (A) What patterns does this illustrate in
    the data?
    a.  Create a bar graph that displays the count of CZs by region
    and fill each bar using information on census division. What
    do you learn from this graph? (A) Make new bar graphs with 
    position `dodge`. (B) Make new bar graphs with position `fill`.
    (C) What is the relative advantage of each of the three bar graphs?

1. **Connecticut Schools**
  Data on schools from the Common Core of Data (CCD) are collected by the
  National Center for Education Statistics. Information about the CCD
  can be found [here](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp).
  We are working with a subset of the 2013-14 dataset,
  `data/ct_schools` in the classnotes repo. A variable
  codebook for the CCD, which will explain what each column represents
  in the data file is located in the `flat file` in the record layout
  column and 2013-14 row.
    a.  Load the appropriate packages and load the data.
    a.  Data manipulation.
        i.   Make a new variable `sch_type` that has the value
  `Charter`,  `Magnet` or `TPS`, to specify if the school is a
  charter, magnet or  traditional public school. 
        i.  How many schools of each of these three types are in our
  area? 
        i.  Make a table that show the number of schools of each of
  the three school types that are missing data for free lunch. 
    a.  Descriptives.
        i.  How many schools are elementary schools? Middle schools?
  High schools? Other? Missing?
        i.  How many schools are eligible for Title I status?
  Summarize the count of schools in each category	 
    a. Racial composition.
        i. Create new variables that compute the percentage of
  students who are Black, White, Hispanic, Asian or another race (call
  this variable "other"), and the percentage of students receiving
  free OR reduced price lunch.
        i. Visualize these data to see the variability of each of
  these variables (Hint: Use `geom_histogram`).
    a.  Visualize the variation in the percent of students receiving
  free lunch (frelch) for magnet schools, TPS, and charter schools
  (Hint: Use `geom_boxplot`).
    a.  Visualize the variation in the percent of students of each
  race and ethnicity in the data file (Black, White, Hispanic, Asian
  and Other) for each of the type of schools (magnet, TPS and
  charter).
    a.  With more R skills what types of questions could you answer
  using this dataset?
    a.  What are some questions you have about this dataset? What
  information would you add to the dataset, if you could?
