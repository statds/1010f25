# Exercises {#sec-ex}


1. **Setting up the computing environment**
  Using the right computing tools and environment is a prerequisite
  of data science projects. Set up your computer for this course
  with the following steps. For each step, document what you did,
  the obstacles you encountered, and how you overcame them. If you
  used AI, document your prompts. Note that the steps you take may
  depend on your computer's operating system.Think of this as a user
  manual for students who are new to this. Use the command line
  interface.
    a.  Install R.
    a.  Install Positron or RStudio.
    a.  Install Quarto.
    a.  Set up SSH authentication between your computer and your
	  GitHub account.
    a.  Render your homework into an HTML file.
    a.  Print the HTML file into a pdf file and put it into the
      release of this homework assignment.
1. **Getting familiar with command line interface**
   The command line interface (CLI) is widely used among computing
   professionals, even though graphical user interfaces (GUI) are more
   common for everyday users. Be clear and concise in your
   explanations. Provide short examples if you think they will help
   illustrate your points.
    a.  Research and explain why many professionals prefer using the
   CLI over a GUI.  Consider aspects such as efficiency, automation,
   reproducibility, or remote access. 
    a.  Identify your top five favorite commands in the Unix/Linux
   shell. For each command, explain what it does. If there is an
   option/flag you found particularly useful, describe it.
    a. Identify your  top five favorite Git commands. For each
   command, explain what it does. If there is an option/flag you found
   particularly useful, describe it.
1. **Do women promote different policies than men?**
  (Based on Raghabendra Chattopadhyay and Esther Duflo. 2004. “Women
  as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in
  India." Econometrica, 72 (5): 1409–43.)
  We will analyze data from an experiment conducted in India, where
  villages were randomly assigned to have a female council head. The
  dataset is in the source of the class notes  “data/india.csv”.  As
  shown in @tbl-india, the dataset contains four variables.
  
   | variable     | description                                                                 |
   |--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | *village*    | village identifier ("Gram Panchayat number _ village number")               |
   | *female*     | whether village was assigned a female politician: 1 = yes, 0 = no           |
   | *water*      | number of new (or repaired) drinking water facilities in the village        |
   |              | since random assignment                                                     |
   | *irrigation* | number of new (or repaired) irrigation facilities in the village            |
   |              | since random assignment                                                     |
   
   : Variables in `india.csv` {#tbl-india}

    a. Using the correct R code, set your working directory.
    a. Load the `tidyverse` package.
    a. Load the data as a `data.frame` and assign the name `india` to
	it.
    a.  Utilizing either `head()` or `glimpse()` view the first few
	rows of the dataset. Substantively describe what these functions
	do.
	a.  What does each observation in this dataset represent?
    a.  Substantively interpret the first observation in the dataset.
    a.  For each variable in the dataset, identify the type of
	variable (character vs. numeric binary vs. numeric non-binary).
    a.  How many observations are in the dataset? In other words, how
	many villages were part of this experiment? Additionally, provide
	a substantive answer.
