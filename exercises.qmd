# Exercises {#sec-ex}


1. **Setting up the computing environment**
  Using the right computing tools and environment is a prerequisite
  of data science projects. Set up your computer for this course
  with the following steps. For each step, document what you did,
  the obstacles you encountered, and how you overcame them. If you
  used AI, document your prompts. Note that the steps you take may
  depend on your computer's operating system.Think of this as a user
  manual for students who are new to this. Use the command line
  interface.
    a.  Install R.
    a.  Install Positron or RStudio.
    a.  Install Quarto.
    a.  Set up SSH authentication between your computer and your
	  GitHub account.
    a.  Render your homework into an HTML file.
    a.  Print the HTML file into a pdf file and put it into the
      release of this homework assignment.

1. **Getting familiar with command line interface**
  The command line interface (CLI) is widely used among computing
  professionals, even though graphical user interfaces (GUI) are more
  common for everyday users. Be clear and concise in your
  explanations. Provide short examples if you think they will help
   illustrate your points.
    a.  Research and explain why many professionals prefer using the
   CLI over a GUI.  Consider aspects such as efficiency, automation,
   reproducibility, or remote access. 
    a.  Identify your top five favorite commands in the Unix/Linux
   shell. For each command, explain what it does. If there is an
   option/flag you found particularly useful, describe it.
    a. Identify your  top five favorite Git commands. For each
   command, explain what it does. If there is an option/flag you found
   particularly useful, describe it.

1. **Do women promote different policies than men?**
   @chattopadhyay2004women studied whether female policymakers make
   different choices than male policymakers by exploiting a unique
   natural experiment in India. India’s 1993 constitutional amendment
   required that one-third of village council head positions
   (pradhans) be randomly reserved for women, creating a setting where
   the assignment of female leaders was exogenous. In the data here,
   villages were randomly assigned to have a female council head. The
   dataset is in the source of the class notes  “data/india.csv”.  As
   shown in @tbl-india, the dataset contains four variables.
  
   | variable     | description                                                                 |
   |--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | *village*    | village identifier ("Gram Panchayat number _ village number")               |
   | *female*     | whether village was assigned a female politician: 1 = yes, 0 = no           |
   | *water*      | number of new (or repaired) drinking water facilities in the village        |
   |              | since random assignment                                                     |
   | *irrigation* | number of new (or repaired) irrigation facilities in the village            |
   |              | since random assignment                                                     |

    a.  For each variable in the dataset, identify the type of
	variable (character vs. numeric binary vs. numeric non-binary).
    a.  How many observations are in the dataset? In other words, how
	many villages were part of this experiment? Additionally, provide
	a substantive answer.

1. **Land of opportunity in the US**
  @chetty2014where show that children’s chances of rising out of
  poverty in the U.S. vary sharply across commuting zones, with
  higher mobility in areas with less segregation, less inequality,
  stronger schools, more two-parent families, and greater social
  capital. The data and its variable dictionary are available as
  `data/Chetty_2014.csv` and `data/Chetty_2014_dict.csv`.
  Here we look into a subset of the data, exploring the
  relationship between economic mobility and CZ characteristics:
  household income per capita (`hhi_percap`). The mobility measure
  that you will use in this analysis captures the probability that a child
  born to a parent in quintile 1 moves to income quintile 5 as an
  adult (`prob_q1q5`).
    a.  Read and filter data to get data only for the 100 largest
    commuting zones (CZ). You will work with filtered data,
  `chetty_top100`, throughout this lab.
    a.   Make a scatterplot with household income per capita
    (`hhi_percap`) on the x-axis, and mobility (`abs_mobility)` on the
    y-axis. (A) Describe the graph: what is the approximate range of
    the  x-axis? (B) What is the approximate range of the y-axis? (C)
    Do you think there is a relationship between these two variables? 
	  a.   Use color to represent the geographic region (region) to your
    scatterplot. (A) What patterns does this reveal? (B) Describe the
    distribution of the data, by region.
    a.  Represent geographic region (region) on your scatterplot using
    shape instead of color. Compare the use of color vs shape to
    represent the region: what are the benefits and drawbacks of each?
    a.  Going back to the graph you just made, which uses
    color to represent the geographic region, add another aesthetic to
    represent the size of the population (`pop_2000`, population from the
    2000 Census). Describe any relationships between size and region.
    a.  Split your plot into facets to display scatterplots of your
    data by region. (A) Compare this split plot to the combined plot 
    earlier. Are there aspects of the relationship between 
    `hhi_percap` and mobility that are easier to detect in the faceted
    plot than in the combined plot? (B) Which regions appear to have
    a relatively stronger relationship between `hhi_percap` and mobility?
    a.  Add information on the census division (`division`) to your
    graph using the color aesthetic. (A) What does this reveal about
    divisional differences in the West?
    a.  Create a plot of the relationship between `hhi_percap` and
    `abs_mobility` with two layers: (1) A scatterplot colored by
    region, and (2) a smooth fit chart with no standard error also
    colored by region. (A) What patterns does this illustrate in
    the data?
    a.  Create a bar graph that displays the count of CZs by region
    and fill each bar using information on census division. What
    do you learn from this graph? (A) Make new bar graphs with 
    position `dodge`. (B) Make new bar graphs with position `fill`.
    (C) What is the relative advantage of each of the three bar graphs?

1. **Connecticut schools**
  Data on schools from the Common Core of Data (CCD) are collected by the
  National Center for Education Statistics. Information about the CCD
  can be found [here](https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/pubschuniv.asp).
  We are working with a subset of the 2013-14 dataset,
  `data/ct_schools` in the classnotes repo. A variable
  codebook for the CCD, which will explain what each column represents
  in the data file is located in the `flat file` in the record layout
  column and 2013-14 row.
    a.  Load the appropriate packages and load the data.
    a.  Data manipulation.
        i.   Make a new variable `sch_type` that has the value
  `Charter`,  `Magnet` or `TPS`, to specify if the school is a
  charter, magnet or  traditional public school. 
        i.  How many schools of each of these three types are in our
  area? 
        i.  Make a table that show the number of schools of each of
  the three school types that are missing data for free lunch. 
    a.  Descriptives.
        i.  How many schools are elementary schools? Middle schools?
  High schools? Other? Missing?
        i.  How many schools are eligible for Title I status?
  Summarize the count of schools in each category	 
    a. Racial composition.
        i. Create new variables that compute the percentage of
  students who are Black, White, Hispanic, Asian or another race (call
  this variable "other"), and the percentage of students receiving
  free OR reduced price lunch.
        i. Visualize these data to see the variability of each of
  these variables (Hint: Use `geom_histogram`).
    a.  Visualize the variation in the percent of students receiving
  free lunch (frelch) for magnet schools, TPS, and charter schools
  (Hint: Use `geom_boxplot`).
    a.  Visualize the variation in the percent of students of each
  race and ethnicity in the data file (Black, White, Hispanic, Asian
  and Other) for each of the type of schools (magnet, TPS and
  charter).
    a.  With more R skills what types of questions could you answer
  using this dataset?
    a.  What are some questions you have about this dataset? What
  information would you add to the dataset, if you could?

1. **Early care and education, NC, 2007–2014**
   The data on early care and education were carefully collected by
   Scott Latham and colleagues at the Stanford Center for Educational
   Policy Analysis, in support of a recent publication, available
   [here](https://cepa.stanford.edu/content/effects-accountability-incentives-early-childhood-education).
   Additional background on North Carolina’s Quality Rating and
   Improvement System (QRIS) can be found
   [here](http://ncchildcare.nc.gov/parents/pr_sn2_ov_sr.asp).
   We have a copy in the classnotes repo:
   `data/NC_ECE_2007-2014.csv`. You can download it into your homework
   repo, but please do not add it to your repo; it's over 11MB.

   Instead of a formal online codebook, Professor Latham provided the
   following description:

   > “We have a panel of all licensed child care providers in North
   > Carolina from 2007 to 2014. This includes both center-based
   > providers and family child care homes. For all providers, we have
   > county identifiers and zip codes. We also know facility types
   > (e.g., independent, Head Start, local public school), enrollment,
   > capacity, and some zip-code-level demographics (e.g., percentage
   > below poverty, percentage Black, percentage Hispanic). For most
   > providers, we have information on quality as measured by North
   > Carolina’s Quality Rating and Improvement System (QRIS). However,
   > many of these indicators are not readily interpretable because they
   > are tied to the QRIS rubric (e.g., a 1–7 measure of teacher/staff
   > education and credentials). The one quality measure that is
   > relatively straightforward to interpret is the ERS rating—a widely
   > used measure of observed classroom quality. These are elective, so
   > we only have them for a subset of providers.”

   a. Load the needed packages and the data. Take a glimpse of the data.
   a. Make a new data frame called `nc14` that contains all NC
      facilities in the year 2014, with the variables `fname`, `zip`,
      `ftype`, `p_pov`, `med_income`, `QRIS_ERS`, and a new variable
      `p_cap = enroll/capacity`. You will use this data frame in the
      remaining questions.
   a.  Make a new data frame that shows the number of facilities
	evaluated in each zip code in 2014, and the value of `p_pov` for
	each zip code.
        i.  Sort by decreasing order in the number of facilities.
		i.  Make a plot from the data frame you made to demonstrate
	variation in percent poverty across zip codes in NC.
        i.  Explain why your plot in is different from a
	plot that demonstrates variation in `p_pov` in the original
	data frame.
   a.  Add a new variable to `nc14` that lumps together various
      facility types into five groups, based on the value of `ftype`,
      as follows: Independent; Franchise; Religious sponsored; Federal,
      Head Start or Local public school; All others. 
       i.  Make a plot to show the variation in `p_cap` across these
       five groups.
   a.  Make a boxplot to visualize covariation between `QRIS_ERS` and
      `med_income`, binning `med_income` to treat it as a categorical
      variable, and representing the number of observations in each
      category by the width of the corresponding box.
   a.  Visualize the relationship between `med_income` and `QRIS_ERS`
      using a scatter plot.
       i.  Visualize the same relationship using `geom_bin2d`. 
	   i.  Discuss the pros and cons of each of these visualizations.

1. **Quality of life, NC**
   This project was created by the UNCC Urban Institute in
   collaboration with the city of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, and
   nearby townships. This dataset describes how various aspects of
   Charlotte residents' "quality of life" varies according to
   neighborhood. You can explore and learn more about this project
   [here](https://ui.charlotte.edu/our-work/quality-life-explorer/).
   The data is `data/qol_PS3.csv`. We explore how adolescent birth
   rate and income are related at the neighborhood level in
   Mecklenburg county.
   
   a.  Load the appropriate packages and load the data.
   a.  Visualize the covariation between the rate of adolescent births
   and median household income. What do you observe about the
   relationship between these variables?
   a.  Create a boxplot of the rate of adolescent birth by household
   income quartile. Use the features of the boxplot (i.e, the bar,
   box, whiskers and dots) to interpret your findings and discuss the
   pros and cons of this visualization, including breaking income up
   by quartile. 
   a.  Use the "cut_width" strategy for binning the household income
   variable. Discuss the pros and cons of this visualization.
   a.  Create a visualization that compares the distributions of the
   rate of adolescent birth for low-income neighborhoods (with a
   median HHI of 24257), and high-income neighborhoods (with a median
   HHI of 48514).
   a. Visualize the combined distribution of adolescent births,
   household income, and access to adequate prenatal care. Note that
   you may want to bin one or more of these variables to visualize
   these relationships, and you will need to find a way to represent a
   third variable.
   a. Describe why you decided to assign variables to the
   asthetics you chose. How did these choices help you tell a   
   compelling story with this visualization? 
   
1. **Quality of life, NC** (continued)
   Conduct your own exploratory data analysis (EDA). Your EDA will be
   graded on your choice of an appropriate research question, the
   clarity of your visualizations, and how well your visualizations
   allow you to recognize patterns in your data and provide insight
   into the question you have posed. 
   a. Pose and answer at minimum four iterative, related EDA
   questions, using a minimum of 3 different variables (as in the last
   exercise). Write as though you were guiding future students through
   an exploration of the data, along with an answer key. Be sure to
   clearly state your EDA question, explain why you chose the
   visualizations that you did, and describe your findings. 
   a. What were the easiest and hardest parts of this assignment?
   a. With more R skills what types of questions could you answer
   using this dataset?
   a. What are some questions you have about this dataset? What
   information would you add to the dataset, if you could?

1. **Role of colleges in economic mobility**
   This exercise is based on a data set from Chetty et al., the same
   author team as the economic mobility data we have worked with, but
   a different paper and different data that examines the role of
   colleges in economic mobility; see `data/mrc.csv`. 
   If you wish, you can read about this

        just produced even though there are only 50 states, and write code
        to show what are in these extra rows.
        i.  For the four CZs in New York with the most colleges, output
        a table of the CZ name, number of colleges in the CZ, and the
        average value of `par_median` in the CZ, sorted by the number of
        colleges in the CZ.
   a.  Compare parent and child median income.
        i.  Make a new variable called `pk_ratio` that is the ratio of
        parent median income to child median income, and another new
        variable to indicate if this ratio is low (\<=2), medium
        (between 2 and 3), or  high (\>= 3).

1. **NYC crashes in the week of Labor Day, 2025** 
   The data come from the NYC Open Data portal: [Motor Vehicle
   Collisions–Crashes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data).
   This dataset contains information reported to the NYPD for motor
   vehicle crashes, available as `data/nyc_crashes_lbdwk_2025.csv`. 
   For this exercise, a subset covering Labor Day week 2025 was
   downloaded. It includes 29 variables, which are explained at the
   portal. The raw data contain missing values in several fields.
   a. Importing the data.
      i.  Read the data into R and take a glimpse.
	  i.  The variable names are all upper-cases, with spaces replaced
      with periods when imported. Rename the variables to use lower
      cases, with underscores in places of spaces (periods).
      i.  Are all the observations really in our target time frame? If not,
      filter out those are not and use the filtered data for the rest
      of the exercise.
      i.  Do you need the `location` variable in the data? What
      suggestion would you give to the data curator?
   a. Missing values.
      i.  Are there borough values that should be coded as `NA`? If
      so, recode them.
      i.  Are there unreasonable geocode (lattitude/longitude) that
      should be coded as `NA`? If so, recode them.
      i.  How many records have geocode missing?
      i.  How many zip code missing and borough missing occur
      simultaneously?
      i.  Create a logical variable `fillable_zip`, which is `TRUE`
      when the geocode is not missing but zip code is missing. Compare
      the rate of fillable zip across the seven days.
   a. Data exploration.
      i.  Create a variable `hour` to store the hour in which a
      collision occurs. 
      i.  Plot the number of crashes by hour by borough, Summarize the
      patterns in the figure (e.g., are there more crashes during rush
      hours?).
	  i.  How many crashes occurred at exactly midnight? How about
		whole hours? Is this a metter of bad luck when the clock
      strikes midnight?
      i.  Create a logical variable `business_day`, which is `TRUE` if
      the day is a business day and `FALSE` otherwise.
      i.  Plot the number of crashes by business day by
      borough. Summarize your observations.
   a. Severity analysis.

      i.  Create a frequency table for the contributing factors for
      vehicle 1. 
      i.  Are there contributing factors differ only in cases? If so,
      convert upper cases to lower cases.
      i.  What are the top five contributing factors?
      i.  Should any values in the frequency table be considered `NA`?
      i.  What are the most frequent vehicle categories in vehicle 1
      and vehicle 2? Comment on the results.
