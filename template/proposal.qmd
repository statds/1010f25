# Project Overview

Briefly describe the goal of your project in **2–3 sentences**.  
What topic or question do you want to explore using data?

::: callout-tip
### Tip
A good project starts with curiosity. Ask: *What do I want to learn or
show with data?*
:::


# Research Questions

List **two specific questions** that your data analysis will answer.

Example:
1. How do housing prices vary across neighborhoods in NYC?
2. What factors are most related to customer satisfaction scores?

# Data Source

Describe the publicly available data you plan to use.

For each source, include:
- **Name and URL**  
- **What it contains** (variables, number of rows/columns if known)  
- **Why it is useful** for your project  


# Planned Methods

Describe, in a few sentences, how you will analyze and visualize the
data. You don’t need advanced methods---just explain your plan clearly.

Examples:

- Build an interactive dashboard using **R Shiny**.  
- Combine two data sets by a common key (e.g., date or location).
